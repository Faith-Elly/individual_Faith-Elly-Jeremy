&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first school that I ever went was actually St Joseph's Chinese Kindergarden but after a few months, I moved to Sk.Surati Kindergarden. 
I had stayed there until I moved to their Primary School. I had moved to Sk St.Mary, Limbahau went I turn 10 years old and was in my primary 4.
One of the main reasons for the changes in school is due to St. Mary being nearer to my house.After finishing my primary school, I moved up to SMK St.
Mary Secondary School. The school was just right next door with the primary one. I continued my studies there until I finsih my secondary schooling. 
My favourite subjects during school was English, History and Science. My least favourite were Maths and Arts. I love learning about history because
I enjoy learning about the past. How our country was made or how we did things during the 1900s. It was a very intresing subject to learn. I love English 
due to the fact I love reading and writing. I wanted to learn how to improve my writings for my fanfiction stories. As for science, I love learning about
animals and plants. My dream was to be veterinarian but I did not do well in Maths. Thus, I decided to give up being one but I still love animals.
